              <p class="p1gr">The geographical landscape of Greece is diverse, featuring a mainland that is largely mountainous, with ranges like the Pindus and Rhodope, and an extensive coastline adorned with numerous islands. The Aegean, Ionian, and Mediterranean seas that surround Greece have shaped its history and culture, fostering maritime trade and the development of a seafaring tradition. The islands, such as Crete, Rhodes, and the Cyclades, are celebrated for their picturesque beauty, vibrant local cultures, and archaeological significance. This natural beauty, combined with the country's pleasant Mediterranean climate, makes Greece a popular destination for tourists seeking both relaxation and adventure.
                  
                  Modern Greece, while deeply rooted in its historical and cultural legacy, is also a vibrant and dynamic member of the European Union. The country's economy has faced significant challenges, especially during the financial crisis of the late 2000s and early 2010s, but it has shown resilience and gradual recovery. Athens, the capital city, is a bustling metropolis that harmoniously blends ancient landmarks with contemporary urban life. Greek cuisine, famous for its use of fresh ingredients and traditional recipes, and the warm hospitality of its people further enhance Greece's appeal, making it a beloved destination for travelers from around the world.

It stretches from the rugged mountains of the north to the fertile plains of the south, encompassing a variety of landscapes that have shaped Greek civilization for millennia. The mainland is home to some of the country’s most significant archaeological sites, including the ancient cities of Athens, Corinth, and Mycenae, each bearing testimony to Greece's rich historical tapestry. In Athens, the Acropolis stands as a symbol of classical Greece, while the ruins of Mycenae offer insights into the early Greek civilization known for its impressive fortresses and tombs.

The Meteora monasteries, perched atop towering rock formations, are a UNESCO World Heritage site and a testament to the region's spiritual heritage. The Pindus mountain range, often referred to as the "spine of Greece," offers rugged landscapes ideal for outdoor activities like hiking, rafting, and skiing. Meanwhile, the fertile plains of Thessaly are known for agriculture and horse breeding, contributing to the country's economy and culinary traditions. The region is also home to the ancient oracle of Delphi, once considered the center of the world by the Greeks, where visitors can explore the ruins and soak in the mystical atmosphere.
                        
                        Southern Greece, particularly the Peloponnese peninsula, is a region steeped in myth and history. It is the site of ancient Sparta, known for its military prowess, and Olympia, the birthplace of the Olympic Games.

                    <div class="infogr">The peninsula has been inhabited since prehistoric times. Its modern name derives from ancient Greek mythology, specifically the legend of the hero Pelops, who was said to have conquered the entire region. The name Peloponnesos means Island or Peninsula (archaic meaning of the word nesos) of Pelops.

                          The Mycenaean civilization, mainland Greece's (and Europe's) first major civilization, dominated the Peloponnese in the Bronze Age from the palaces of Mycenae, Pylos and Tiryns; among others. The Mycenaean civilization collapsed suddenly at the end of the 2nd millennium BC. Archeological research has found that many of its cities and palaces show signs of destruction.</div>

      <div class="panelgr">
              <p class="p1gr">The Greek islands, scattered across the Aegean and Ionian seas, are renowned for their stunning natural beauty, rich history, and vibrant cultures. With over 6,000 islands and islets, of which around 227 are inhabited, the Greek islands offer a diverse array of experiences. The Cyclades, a group of islands in the Aegean Sea, are particularly famous for their white-washed buildings, crystal-clear waters, and lively nightlife. Santorini, with its breathtaking sunsets and volcanic landscapes, and Mykonos, known for its cosmopolitan atmosphere and beaches, are among the most popular destinations in the Cyclades, attracting millions of tourists each year.

                      The Dodecanese islands, located in the southeastern Aegean Sea, are steeped in history and cultural heritage. Rhodes, the largest of the Dodecanese, boasts a well-preserved medieval town that is a UNESCO World Heritage site. The island's history spans ancient Greek, Roman, Byzantine, and Ottoman periods, reflected in its architecture and archaeological sites. Another gem in the Dodecanese is Patmos, known as the "Jerusalem of the Aegean" for its significance in Christian history; it is where Saint John the Theologian is said to have written the Book of Revelation. The island's serene atmosphere and spiritual significance attract both pilgrims and tourists seeking tranquility.

        <button class="accordiongr">Cuisine</button>
        <div class="panelgr">
              <p class="p1gr">Greek cuisine is a vibrant tapestry woven from the country's rich history, diverse geography, and deep-rooted cultural traditions. At its core, Greek cooking emphasizes fresh, high-quality ingredients, simple preparations, and robust flavors. Olive oil, often referred to as "liquid gold," is a staple in Greek kitchens, used generously in cooking and salads. Fresh vegetables, grains, legumes, seafood, and a variety of meats, particularly lamb and goat, form the backbone of many dishes. Herbs such as oregano, mint, and dill, along with spices like cinnamon and cloves, add depth and complexity to Greek flavors, reflecting influences from the Mediterranean and the Near East.

                        One of the most iconic aspects of Greek cuisine is its array of meze, or small dishes, which are often enjoyed as appetizers or shared among friends over a leisurely meal. These small plates include favorites like tzatziki, a creamy yogurt and cucumber dip; dolmades, grape leaves stuffed with rice and herbs; and spanakopita, a savory spinach and feta pie wrapped in flaky phyllo pastry. Meze showcases the diversity and creativity of Greek cooking, allowing diners to experience a wide range of flavors and textures in one sitting. These dishes are typically accompanied by bread and olives, and often paired with ouzo, a traditional anise-flavored spirit, or local wines.
              </p>

                <div class="columngr">
                  <img src="Meze dishes.jpg" alt="An image shows meze dishes" style="width:100%">
                    <div class="infogr">One of the greatest parts of dining in Greece is the tradition of meze, also known as tapas, antipasto, merende, and even hors d’oeuvres. They’re small, savory plates of food enjoyed in a convivial atmosphere, and they make up a whole pan-Mediterranean culture: that of sharing food and drink with friends in an unrushed, unharried environment.

                          The word “meze” itself means “middle,” as in middle of the day, or between meals – this is crucial because the meze table is not and should not be a full meal. Instead, it is something that falls in the middle of the day or before dinner, usually alongside alcohol. </div>
                    </div>

              <p class="p1gr">
                        Seafood plays a crucial role in Greek cuisine, especially in coastal regions and islands. Fresh fish, octopus, and shellfish are commonly grilled, baked, or marinated, highlighting the natural flavors of the sea. One popular seafood dish is grilled octopus, tenderized and charred to perfection, often served with a squeeze of lemon and a drizzle of olive oil. Another beloved dish is psari plaki, where fish is baked with tomatoes, onions, and herbs, creating a flavorful and aromatic entrée. The emphasis on fresh, locally sourced ingredients ensures that seafood dishes are both delicious and sustainable, reflecting Greece's deep connection to the sea.
                        
                        Greek cuisine is also famous for its desserts, which often feature nuts, honey, and aromatic spices. Baklava, perhaps the most well-known Greek dessert, is a rich and sweet pastry made of layers of phyllo dough, filled with chopped nuts, and soaked in honey or syrup. Another favorite is galaktoboureko, a custard-filled pastry that is both creamy and crisp. For those seeking something lighter, Greek yogurt drizzled with honey and topped with nuts or fresh fruit offers a simple yet satisfying end to a meal. The tradition of hospitality, or philoxenia, means that sharing food is central to Greek culture, and meals are often occasions for gathering with family and friends, reinforcing bonds and celebrating life.

                    <div class="infogr">Baklava is a traditional Greek treat features multiple layers of thin, buttery phyllo dough, meticulously stacked and filled with a mixture of finely chopped walnuts or almonds, and fragrant spices like cinnamon. Once baked to a golden perfection, the baklava is generously soaked in a honey-based syrup infused with lemon and occasionally a hint of cinnamon or cloves, which permeates the layers and enhances the sweetness. </div>
